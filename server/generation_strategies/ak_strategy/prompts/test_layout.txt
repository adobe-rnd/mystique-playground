Your main goal is to change the layout by placing the image to the left without changing the image size and output only the modified CSS.
Additional Requirements:
- Adjust the position of the text accordingly for the new layout.
- Change the font family to something more modern.
- Do not update other properties unrelated to the main goal.
- Use !important only on properties where you made changes.

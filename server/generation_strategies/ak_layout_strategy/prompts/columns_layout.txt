Your main goal is to come up with a brand new layout to create a distinct looking design.
Additional Requirements:
- Output only the modified CSS with your innovative changes.
- Think deeply about layouts that spans across multiple rows and columns or combinations of both.
- The image can be to the left or top of the text content.
- Prioritize the readability of the text content.
- Add any new CSS variables and use them but do not modify any existing CSS variables.
- Do not modify the font family.
- Do not change the position of the button.
- Do not modify other properties unrelated to the main goal.
- Do not add unnecessary background colors.
- Use !important on all the properties.

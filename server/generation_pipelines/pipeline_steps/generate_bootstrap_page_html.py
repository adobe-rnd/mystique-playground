            Design a responsive web page using the content provided below. The page should be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and styled consistently with the provided design references.
            
            Requirements:
            
            - The output should be in a single HTML file with all styles embedded within <style> tags.
            - Use Bootstrapâ€™s grid system for the layout structure, and include appropriate Bootstrap components such as buttons, cards, alerts, and navigation bars.
            - The design should match the visual style seen in the provided screenshot, including color schemes, fonts, padding, and margins.
            - Ensure the page includes essential web elements (headers, paragraphs, lists, images, buttons, links, etc.).
            - Organize the content into a clean hierarchy with clear section divisions.
            - The page should either be 70% or 100% width, centered on the screen based on best design practices.
            
            CDN Links for Bootstrap:
            
            <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
            <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
            
            Provided Data:
            
            Page Content:
            {text_content}
            
            Image Information (including URLs):
            {'\n'.join(image_info_list)}
            
            Important Notes:
            
            - The layout should be clean, well-organized, and visually balanced.
            - Pay attention to typography (font styles, sizes, and weights) and spacing (padding, margins) to align with the provided design reference.
            - Ensure all links and buttons are styled consistently and are easy to interact with.
            - Follow accessibility best practices, including using proper alt text for images and ARIA attributes where relevant.
